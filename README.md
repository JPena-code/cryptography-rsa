# RSA Simulator and Implementation

## RSA Simulation
The RSA simulator is maded with own implementations of the algoritms needed to take place the encription of a message using _RSA_, starting from taking an integer pair $p,q$ through the key pair integers $d, e$
### Primality Test

## RSA Implementation
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
$ pip install cryptography
$ pip install bcrypt
```
